The ultimatum, set for July 7, 2024, marks a significant shift in regulatory expectations and aims to standardize operations across the board. This directive, which emerged from a pivotal meeting between the CAC's Registrar-General, Hussaini Magaji, and fintech stakeholders, extends to all financial institutions with P.O.S.services. This step is seen not as a targeted measure but as an alignment with existing legal frameworks and CBN's guidelines on agent banking, ensuring that all parties adhere to the Companies and Allied Matters Act, CAMA 2020. Implications for Financial Institutions and P.O.S.Merchants For P.O.S.merchants, this means they must formalize their operations by registering as business entities with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). This measure is very important for regulators to know who runs what business and in what part of the country. The stakes are even higher for financial institutions, as they are required to re-evaluate and re-onboard their P.O.S.networks, potentially severing ties with non-compliant entities post-deadline. This measure may appear stringent, but it is pivotal in the fight against financial fraud caused by fraudulent activities from P.O.S.terminals. How Should Financial Institutions Onboard New P.O.S.Merchants? To ensure compliance with new regulations and protect their institutions from risky operators, financial institutions must take the following steps to verify potential P.O.S.operators and protect their businesses: Registration Requirement: Every P.O.S.operator must register their business with the CAC. Verification Process: Using a trusted business verification tool, financial institutions need to verify that each merchant is registered and compliant with the CAC. Integration of AML Checks: As part of the onboarding process, P.O.S.merchants must undergo Anti-Money Laundering checks to ensure their operations and/the Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs) do not pose a risk of financial crimes. Compliance Monitoring: Continuous monitoring to ensure ongoing compliance with the CBN guidelines and CAMA 2020. Streamlining Compliance through Technological Solutions To facilitate a smooth transition and ensure compliance, financial institutions must re-onboard P.O.S.operators on their platform and verify the legitimacy of the CAC certificates presented.

CONSEQUENCES... ```` The document discusses the consequences of not registering for P.O.S.operators in Nigeria: * **For P.O.S.Merchants:** * **Non-compliance with regulations:** They will be operating outside the legal framework set by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA). * **Risk of being cut off by financial institutions:** Banks and other financial institutions might stop working with them if they are not registered with CAC by the deadline. * **For Financial Institutions:** * **Potential association with fraudulent activities:**  They could be seen as negligent if they continue working with unregistered P.O.S.operators, which might be involved in fraud. * **Difficulties onboarding new P.O.S.merchants:**  The process will be more complex and time-consuming if they cannot easily verify the legitimacy of potential partners. Overall, not registering can lead to operational disruptions and reputational damage for both P.O.S.operators and financial institutions. ``` BONUSES: CTA blble says 7 "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. 8 When I say to the wicked, ‘You wicked person, you will surely die,’ and you do not speak out to dissuade them from their ways, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. 9 But if you do warn the wicked person to turn from their ways and they do not do so, they will die for their sin, though you yourself will be saved."
